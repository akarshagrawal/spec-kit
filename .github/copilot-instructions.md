# Modernization Spec Kit

This workspace has been successfully set up as a **Modernization Spec Kit** project focused on specification-driven modernization using strangler-fig patterns.

## Available Commands

- `/speckit.constitution` - Create or update modernization governing principles
- `/speckit.specify` - Define what legacy system you want to modernize  
- `/speckit.plan` - Create modernization plans with mind maps and strangler-fig strategy
- `/speckit.implement` - Execute modernization systematically

## Key Features

- **Strangler-Fig Patterns**: Gradual legacy system replacement
- **Risk-Driven Planning**: Prioritize by business impact and technical debt
- **Mind Mapping**: Visualize complex modernization areas
- **Incremental Value Delivery**: Continuous user improvements
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Safe transformation with fallback plans

## Project Structure

The project uses a streamlined approach with just four core commands for comprehensive modernization workflows. All modernization intelligence is built into these commands to focus on constitution, specification, planning, and implementation phases.
