# [PROJECT_NAME] Modernization Constitution
<!-- Example: Legacy System Modernization Constitution, Platform Migration Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Modernization Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
<!-- Example: I. Strangler-Fig Pattern (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: All modernization follows strangler-fig pattern; New functionality wraps legacy gradually; Legacy components retired only after new system proves stable; No big-bang migrations -->

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: II. Risk-First Assessment -->
[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Identify highest-risk legacy components first; Prioritize by business impact and technical debt; Document dependencies before touching any legacy code; Create rollback plans for every migration step -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Incremental Value Delivery -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every modernization phase must deliver measurable business value; Users see improvements continuously; No feature freezes during modernization; Maintain backward compatibility until deprecation -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
